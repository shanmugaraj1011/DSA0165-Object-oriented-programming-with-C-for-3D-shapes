public:
    Bus(int capacity) : capacity(capacity) {}
    int calculateCapacity(int numBuses) {
        return capacity * numBuses;
    }
};
int main() {
    Bus bus(48);
    int totalCapacity = bus.calculateCapacity(3);
    std::cout << "Three buses can carry " << totalCapacity << " children." << std::endl;
